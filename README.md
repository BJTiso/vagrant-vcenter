[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) provider for VMware vCenterÂ®
=============

[Version 0.2.1](../../releases/tag/v0.2.1) has been released!
-------------

Please note that this software is still Alpha/Beta quality and is not recommended for production usage.

We have a wide array of boxes available at [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/gosddc) you can use them directly or you can roll your own as you please, make sure to install VMware tools in it.

Changes in [version 0.2.1](../../releases/tag/v0.2.1) include:

Fixes

- Hostname using linux prep needs to be hostname and domain not fqdn on both.
- Checking the power state at that spot can cause ruby exceptions to be thrown.

Thanks to [Karl Pietri](https://github.com/BarnacleBob) for this PR.

Install
-------------

Latest version can be easily installed by running the following command:

```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vcenter```

Vagrant will download all the required gems during the installation process.

If you already have the plugin installed you can use:

```vagrant plugin upgrade vagrant-vcenter```

To perform an upgrade to the latest version.

After the install has completed a ```vagrant up --provider=vcenter``` will trigger the newly installed provider.

Configuration
-------------

Here's a sample Multi-VM Vagrantfile:

```ruby
nodes = [
  { hostname: 'web-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' },
  { hostname: 'ssh-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' },
  { hostname: 'sql-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' },
  { hostname: 'lb-vm', box: 'gosddc/precise32' }
]

Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|

  config.vm.provider :vcenter do |vcenter|
    vcenter.hostname = 'my.vcenter.hostname'
    vcenter.username = 'myUsername'
    vcenter.password = 'myPassword'
    vcenter.folder_name = 'myFolderName'
    vcenter.datacenter_name = 'MyDatacenterName'
    vcenter.computer_name = 'MyHostOrCluster'
    vcenter.datastore_name = 'MyDatastore'
    vcenter.template_folder_name = 'My/Template/Folder/Path'
    vcenter.network_name = 'myNetworkName'
    # If you want to use linked clones, set this to true
    vcenter.linked_clones = true
  end

  # Go through nodes and configure each of them.j
  nodes.each do |node|
    config.vm.define node[:hostname] do |node_config|
      node_config.vm.box = node[:box]
      node_config.vm.hostname = node[:hostname]
      node_config.vm.box_url = node[:box_url]
    #   node_config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|
    #     puppet.manifests_path = 'puppet/manifests'
    #     puppet.manifest_file = 'site.pp'
    #     puppet.module_path = 'puppet/modules'
    #     puppet.options = "--verbose --debug"
    #   end
    end
  end
end
```

What is still missing:

- TEST SUITES! (working on that).
- Speed, the code is definitely not optimized.
- Thorough testing.
- Error checking is absymal.
- Some spaghetti code here and there.
- Bugs, bugs and BUGS!.
